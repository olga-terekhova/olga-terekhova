[Background](https://www.linkedin.com/in/olga-terekhova/) in data engineering, business analysis and project management

⚒️ SQL and Python for work and for life 🍴

- I live in 🍁. Recently got my Canadian citizenship. I got bored of checking the citizenship application tracker every day! I scripted this mundane activity at https://github.com/olga-terekhova/check-citizenship.

- My city is Toronto 🏙️. One of the advantages of living here is having a lot of physicians and specialist doctors. See for yourself at https://github.com/olga-terekhova/physicians-availability. 

- I'm a huge believer in urban life 🌇. I want our cities to be smart and convenient, our buildings to be safe and functional. In my capstone project for [Vector Institute](https://vectorinstitute.ai/) [Mothers and Machine Learning program](https://vectorinstitute.ai/mothers-and-machine-learning/) I used ML algorithms to understand the impact of various factors on indoor CO2 levels. Check it at https://github.com/olga-terekhova/weather-co2.

- When I'm wearing two hats at the same time, one of a data professional and one of a mom, I explain what data is using lists of classmates as an example 🏫📋. I make stuff like figuring out how to automatically [generate the weird TDSB school calendar](https://github.com/olga-terekhova/tdsb-calendar) or analyzing [whether a vendor of extracurricular activities offers them equally across TDSB schools](https://github.com/olga-terekhova/data-analysis/tree/main/vendor-extracurriculars-choice).
