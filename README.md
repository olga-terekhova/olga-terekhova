I live in 🇨🇦. I'm waiting for my Canadian citizenship and I got bored of checking the citizenship application tracker everyday! Now scripting this mundane activity at https://github.com/olga-terekhova/check-citizenship.

My city is Toronto. One of the advantages of living here is having a lot of physicians and specialist doctors. Check it at https://github.com/olga-terekhova/physicians-availability.
