In ♥️ with all things data. [Background](https://www.linkedin.com/in/olga-terekhova/) in data engineering, business analysis and project management. 

Alumna of [Vector Institute](https://vectorinstitute.ai/) [Mothers and Machine Learning program](https://vectorinstitute.ai/mothers-and-machine-learning/). My capstone projects is at https://github.com/olga-terekhova/weather-co2.

I live in 🇨🇦. I'm waiting for my Canadian citizenship and I got bored of checking the citizenship application tracker everyday! Now scripting this mundane activity at https://github.com/olga-terekhova/check-citizenship.

My city is Toronto. One of the advantages of living here is having a lot of physicians and specialist doctors. Check it at https://github.com/olga-terekhova/physicians-availability.
