[Background](https://www.linkedin.com/in/olga-terekhova/) in data engineering, business analysis and project management

🍴 SQL and Python for work and for life

- I live in 🍁. Currently waiting for my Canadian citizenship, got bored of checking the citizenship application tracker every day! Now scripting this mundane activity at https://github.com/olga-terekhova/check-citizenship.

- My city is Toronto. One of the advantages of living here is having a lot of physicians and specialist doctors. See for yourself at https://github.com/olga-terekhova/physicians-availability. 

- I'm a huge believer in urban life 🌇. I want our cities to be smart and convenient, our buildings to be safe and functional. In my capstone project for [Vector Institute](https://vectorinstitute.ai/) [Mothers and Machine Learning program](https://vectorinstitute.ai/mothers-and-machine-learning/) I used ML algorithms to understand the impact of various factors on indoor CO2 levels. Check it at https://github.com/olga-terekhova/weather-co2.
