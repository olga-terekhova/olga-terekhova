[Background experience](https://www.linkedin.com/in/olga-terekhova/) in data engineering, business analysis and project management.

SQL and Python for work and for life.

- I live in Canada. When I was waiting to get my Canadian citizenship, I got bored of checking the citizenship application tracker every day, so I scripted this mundane activity at https://github.com/olga-terekhova/check-citizenship.
    - When I decided to rewrite a similar utility using playwright on python, I had to figure out how to [containerize AWS Lambda functions](https://github.com/olga-terekhova/lambda-python-playwright-chromium) and [run them locally](https://github.com/olga-terekhova/lambda-local-run).  

- My city is Toronto. One of the advantages of living here is having a lot of physicians and specialist doctors. See for yourself at https://github.com/olga-terekhova/physicians-availability. 

- I'm a huge believer in urban life. I want our cities to be smart and convenient, our buildings to be safe and functional. In my capstone project for [Vector Institute](https://vectorinstitute.ai/) [Mothers and Machine Learning program](https://vectorinstitute.ai/mothers-and-machine-learning/) I used ML algorithms to understand the impact of various factors on indoor CO2 levels. Check it at https://github.com/olga-terekhova/weather-co2.

- When I'm wearing two hats at the same time, one of a data professional and one of a mom, I explain what data is using lists of classmates as an example. Or I make stuff like:
  - automating the [creation of printables](https://github.com/olga-terekhova/vba)  
  - figuring out how to automatically [generate the weird TDSB school calendar](https://github.com/olga-terekhova/tdsb-calendar)
  - analyzing [whether a vendor of extracurricular activities offers them equally across TDSB schools](https://github.com/olga-terekhova/data-analysis/tree/main/vendor-extracurriculars-choice)
  - creating utilities to [manipulate PDF files](https://github.com/olga-terekhova/pdf-utilities) or to [make conversions between video, audio, and text media](https://github.com/olga-terekhova/info-media-tools)
  - rendering [slides into web pages](https://github.com/olga-terekhova/ppt-render-html)
